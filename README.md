# Text To Graph

An HTML/Javascript utility that converts simle sentences into Graph diagrams. The goal is to quickly and easily create Graph diagrams for presentations or high-level design.

This utility is built on top of the [Arrows Library](https://github.com/apcj/arrows).

## How do I use it?

Simply download all files and open-up the `text2graph.html` file with a Browser.

## How do I draw a graph?

Just type-in simple sentences, such as:
>Jenny is friends with Bob

or
>Bob works for Nulli

You can also add properties to the Graph Nodes and Vertices, using a `-` delimiter. Example:
>Jenny - "mail": "jenny@example.com", "phone": "604.111.2233"

**Note**: the quotes (`"`)are important in the properties.

## Limitations

The algorithm for placing nodes is not all that clever (yet), playing with the sentences, and their order may help if proper positioning of the Nodes. There is also a limit to the number of nodes that can be drawn. Think of only drawing 1 node of each type to keep things high-level/clear.
